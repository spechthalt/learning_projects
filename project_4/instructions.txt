Instructions / Hints for Project 4

1.  Pull down the latest changes on github.

2.  Open the website using MAMP (use "localhost:8888/project_4/" in your URL bar).

3.  Play around with the very simple website I've created for you. See if you can
    understand how I've built it. You'll also notice there are now some PHP tags
    which is nothing to worry about. It's just like a HTML tag but whatever is 
    inside of the PHP tags is valid PHP. I'm including HTML from the "partials"
    folder using the PHP. You'll also notice all the files are no longer .html
    files and are instead .php files. This is a requirement of PHP, you need the
    files to have the .php extension for PHP to work within them. It's JUST like
    .html files so nothing changes but the name.

4.  See if you can add the navigation bar to all the pages that are missing it.

5.  Once the navigation is working. See if you can create a "footer" to include
    at the bottom of every page. The HTML for the footer should be in it's own
    "partial" file and should be included on all 5 pages with PHP -- just like 
    the navigation was. The footer can look however you want.

6.  This one is pretty easy compared to the others (work load wise). When you're
    done with this, let me know and we'll set up the next Zoom call.
