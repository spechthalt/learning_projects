 * PROBLEM 3
 * Intructions:
 * We have the same array of grades from problem 2, but now there are 
 * some grades that have been entered incorrectly by some minumum wage
 * college student who wasn't paying attention.
 * 
 * Output the average again, but this time ignore any grades that have
 * a value greater than 100 or less than 0. Those grades would not be
 * possible in this case.
 * 
 * You should be using if-statments to do this.
