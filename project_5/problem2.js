/**
 * PROBLEM 2
 * Intructions:
 * Given the list of "grades" that are stored in the array, calculate the
 * average and output the result to the console using the "averageGrade"
 * variable that has also been created for you already.
 * 
 * To do this you will need a loop. There are multiple tpes of loops/functions
 * that can work for this, but the basic "for" loop is a good place to start.
 * (You're supposed to use google, don't worry)
 * 
 * The array of grades could have thousands of grades in it. Your code needs
 * to work no matter what array of grades was given to you.
 * 
 * DO NOT use the "reduce" function that you may see on Google. That's cheating ;)
