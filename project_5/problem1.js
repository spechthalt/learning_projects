/**
 * PROBLEM 1
 * Intructions:
 * Here we have a new type of variable type called an "array". It's just a 
 * list of variables instead of one at a time. You can have an array of anything
 * you'd like -- doesn't just have to be numbers. The [] square brackets indicate
 * an array and all elements are seperated by a comma. 
 * 
 * I've initialized a variable named `outPutValue` that you should use to output
 * the correct answer to the console. You'll see the console log at the bottom that
 * has already been written for you.
 * 
 * I've also initialized the array using the word "const" rather than "let". They
 * both work the same way, except anything using the word "const" becomees a 
 * "constant" value. That means you can't change the value of it later in the code.
 * Those are the only two ways people declare variables, it's either "let" or "const".
 * "var" actually works too, but that's the old way to do things and it's been
 * replaced with "let". If you see "var" on google, replace it with "let" and it
 * will work all the same.
 * 
 * The goal of this problem is to store the fourth value in the array (34) to the
 * "outPutValue" variable I created for you. It's REALLY easy -- can be done with
 * 1 line. You'll know you've done it when the console.log output says "34" next
 * to problem 1. Use Google to get some arrays basics to figure this out if you
 * have to.

// Your code goes here



// Don't remove this console.log
