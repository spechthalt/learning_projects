Hints to get this one done


1. You'll need the quicksand font you used in project 2. You can get that on Google Fonts.

2. You'll need to use "position: absolute;" in CSS to get the bed to be in the position you want.

3. No need to make this look good on mobile screens. Just make it look good at a width that's similar to the design.

4. The stars should be a background image in CSS. The logo and bed should be img tags in HTML.

5. Push you code up at the end by using git. The following commands are how you do that:
    git add -a
    git commit -m "Any custom diescription goes here"
    git push

    You can also use "git status" at any point to see all the changes you've made in the terminal.
